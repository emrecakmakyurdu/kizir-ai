Understanding the factors that influence acceptance of information technology is of interest both to researchers in a variety of fields as well as procurers of technology for organizations. In that, researchers have studied a range of issues related to IT Acceptance. At the highest level, `acceptance` has been regarded as the theoretical analysis of innovation diffusion. This approach is appropriate to start with basic of IT acceptance. However, rather than general technological innovations, precise analysis of information technology acceptance has become a central concern of disciplines. This course aims to focus directly on the determinants and importance of user acceptance, rather than the broad issues of social diffusion. A number of theoretical approaches shall be investigated throughout the semester for a complete understanding of the issues involved with IT acceptance. In that regard, in addition to independently examining these approaches, other fundamental issues including information technology management frameworks, information technology governance, control of information technology will also be covered in class particularly concentrating on the relationships between these fundamental issues and information technology acceptance.
