2024-2025 Fall|909|MMI|9090513|ALGORITHMS FOR INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS|3|8.0|1|15|Wednesday|09:40|12:30|HÜSEYİN HACIHABİBOĞLU|Prof.Dr.|English|Graduate|Via this course and by the successful completion thereof, the students will:Learn the fundamental algorithms that are used in interactive systems such as games, AR, VR, and MR applicationsUnderstand the proper use of variants of different algorithms as well as their interactionsImprove their algorithm development skills without getting hindered by lower level programming languages.Develop an interactive application using some of the algorithms taught during the course.||A practical understanding of algorithms is necessary to develop interactive systems such as games, virtual/augmented/mixed reality and other interactive applications. This course aims to teach algorithms relevant in the context of designing interactive systems. The topics to be covered include random number generation, noise generation, procedural content generation, tournament modelling, game trees, path finding, group movement modelling, decision making and modelling uncertainty. Networking related topics will also be covered. The course is predominantly practical where the algorithms and their use will be described and implementation of major algorithms will be demonstrated with collaborative coding tools in class using Python. The assessment will be via programming assignments and a term project.
2024-2025 Fall|909|MMI|9090522|PROCEDURAL SOUND DESIGN|3|8.0|1|15|Friday|09:40|12:30|HÜSEYİN HACIHABİBOĞLU|Prof.Dr.|English|Graduate|Manual generation of game assets is a time consuming and costly process. In addition fixed, uncontrollable assets do not allow the modification of content with interaction. Procedural content generation is the name given to the set of techniques that focus on designing models that can be parametrically controlled. Procedural content generation and design are slowly becoming the norm in game development. The major advantage of procedural sound design is the substantial reduction in the effort required to record sounds. In addition it allows the game designer to avoid repetition by parametrically modifying the sound synthesis algorithms and the sounds that they generate in effect.The objective of this course is to equip the students with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to generate natural sounding, parametrically controllable artificial sound synthesis algorithms and sound effects.|Upon successful completion of this course the students will:learn the basic concepts of procedural sound design,learn the basics of human auditory system, auditory cognition, auditory memorylearn to use the Pure Data graphical programming languagelearn the basic artificial sound synthesis techniqueslearn to carry out modular analysis on sounding objects and combine different components in a meaningful and systematic waylearn about event-based parametric sound synthesis modelsgain practical experience in designing a variety of sound effects that can be used in gamesdesign, test, and deploy their first parametric sound synthesis model|Games are interactive applications and game worlds change with interaction. Audio content in games and virtual reality are typically canned recordings that are impossible to modify during runtime, preventing interactivity, causing repetition and increasing the memory footprint. Procedural audio generation by using interactive synthesis algorithms is a solution to circumvent these problems. This course aims to introduce the students to the concepts and underpinnings of procedural audio as well as give them the practical knowhow on procedural sound design for games.
