As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about differenttypesof structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language.|Natural language and linguistic knowledge. Language and grammar. Morphology. Syntax and grammatical structure. Semantics: Word meaning and grammatical meaning. Regular expressions and regular grammars. Push-down automata. An introduction to Parsing and derivation.|By the end of the semester, a successful student is expected to be able to:- construct and understand basic morphological and syntactic analyses of natural languge structure.- appreciate the structure dependent nature of human languages and how this is studied from a computational perspective.- construct automata, write regular expressions, construct grammars for computational tasks.- understand the complexity classes of formal languages, and their relation to automata- appreciate the close links between language, cognition and computation.

For this purpose, the statistics textbook by Andy Field (2013, 4th edition) “Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics” is being taught. It comprises all major statistical tests, parametric (General Linear Models) and non-parametric, see course syllabus.This objective is reached by regularly attending the weekly lectures of the course instructor, three home-works, two short quizzes, and one exam at the end of the course.Minor objectives of this course are to provide students with an idea how to design experiments, operationalize their research idea, formulate hypotheses, interpret and report the statistical results.|Research methods: The students will be introduced to basic concepts of empirical research and experimental design: independent/dependent variable(s), variance. Methods and methodology of psychological research: experiment, observation, ex-post-facto design, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies. Statistics: The students will be introduced to Descriptive Statistics: building statistical models, the reason between polulation-sample, distributions, various mean values, variance, SD, SE, confidential intervals, test statistics, as well as to Inferential Statistics: General Linear Model (GLM), various forms of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, mixed design ANOVA). Correlation. Regression. Non-paramatic tests. Factor analysis. Statistical analyses will be conducted using SPSS. Designing and reporting experiments.|At the end of the course students will be able to(1) choose appropriate statistical tests for a given research design and data sample(2) use (the current version of) IBM-SPSS(3) all major General Linear Models as well as Non-Parametric Models in the scope of the textbook(4) report the descriptive and inferential outcomes of the statistical tests and illustrate them graphically

The research paradigms that study cognition beyond the actions and mental activities of an individual agent, such as distributed and extended cognition approaches, will be starting points for understanding human collaboration and cooperation in the forms of teamwork for small groups (that can afford direct, real-time, face-to-face, or online communication), and collective intelligence for organizations and societal structures. Starting from the relevant literature and research in cognitive science, contributions to the field from other research disciplines, including organizational behavior and theory, will be surveyed. A parallel literature of organizational behavioral sciences and industrial psychology has been studying collective cognition phenomena from perspectives of team collaboration, group dynamics and shared cognition. The main goal of this course is to examine and|Student should be able to:describe and discern the notions and phenomena of distributed and extended cognitiondescribe alternative approaches to the notion of collective intelligencecharacterize the conditions and mechanisms of wisdom of the crowds effectspecify distinctions between team and individual level cognitive mechanisms in the context of collaborationdescribe and characterize the supra-communicative functions of language describe and characterize how communication can function as computation

Students will first be introduced to the history of Cognitive Science and to major debates in the field (rationalism vs. empiricism, modularity, meaning of data). Subsequently the major empirical research domains of Cognitive Science will be covered on a weekly basis (language, vision, attention, learning and memory, theory of mind, action, evolution, brain, emotional and social aspects of cognition.) General academic skills such as academic reading, writing and discussion will be fostered through homework assignments and active in-class participation of students. Specific academic skills will be conveyed through three alternating blocks of teaching and practical hands-on training (conducting and analyzing experiments, collecting and presenting own data). The course aims at providing an overview over the inter-disciplinary field of Cognitive Science and to motivating students to further explore the various tracks offered by the program in their subsequent studies (computation, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology.)|Not Available

The concept of ""emergence"" - whether and how novelty can arise in a dynamic system - will be discussed in philosophical terms.Third, the fundamental property of objects in the real world as well as (cognitive) processes of being ""fractal"" (spatially as well as temporally) will be brought to the attention to students."|Introduction to  various dynamical approaches to Cognitive Science (e.g., non-linear dynamical systems theory ,synergetics, chaos theory)-Basic mathematics of non-linear dynamical systems- Dynamical concepts (e.g., chaos, fractals, attractors, bifurcation, self-organization, symmetry-breaking)-Dynamical approaches in relation to computational and connectionist approaches to Cognitive Science-Theory, methodology and empirical applications of dynamical systems to major areas in Cognitive Science (neuronal self-organizations, visual perception, coordinated action, learning and memory, cognitive development, language/language acquisition, attention/consciousness, and social psychology)-The philosophy of emergence- Hands-on practical training with HTML-based educational material on the mathematics and science of fractals and chaos.|First, students will be able to critically evaluate and compare the three main approaches to Cognition – computational theory of mind, connectionism, dynamic systems – with each other. They will be knowledgeable about the distinctive properties and features of non-linear dynamic systems, most prominently attractors, chaos, and self-organization.Second, students will gain basic and, depending on their choice of specialty topic, deeper understanding of the application of dynamic systems to major fields in cognition.Third, students will appreciate the ubiquitous fractal structure of objects and processes in the real world as well as processes in cognition.

Students will be expected to compare insights obtained from situated analyses of cognition with other methods/conceptual frameworks they are familiar with. They will also be introduced a particular research method that they can employ to investigate cognitive phenomena from a situated perspective.|this course will introduce topics that are gaining increasing interest in cognitive science, such as embodiment, cognitive artifacts, affordances, extended cognition, distributed/group cognition and intersubjectivity. the course involves several readings that offer a re-examination of various domains of cognitive science such as thinking, reasoning, planning, learning, perception, representation and communication from a situated cognition perspective. Interaction Analysis will be introduced as a research metedology to study various aspects of cognition from a situated cognition perspective. Excerpts from online chat logs and face to face interactions will be analyzed from both conventional and situated perspectivies to discuss existing theoritical and empirical positions regarding various cognitive processes such as reasoning, perception and social interaction.|This course will allow students to learn about emerging concepts and theories in Cognitive Science that focus on the interplay between the individual agent and its social/material context to study cognition. The course will complement the perspectives offered by other disciplines of the program by providing a situated action perspective towards fundamental cognitive mechanisms such as reasoning, planning and social cognition. The conceptual and theoretical aspects of the course will also be supplemented by empirical case studies of social interaction. Hence, students will have a chance to critically evaluate various theoretical positions in cognitive science by conducting empirical analysis of social interaction. This will allow students to explore qualitative methodologies used in several fields related to Cognitive Science such as cognitive anthropology, socio-linguistics and learning sciences.
