In addition fixed, uncontrollable assets do not allow the modification of content with interaction. Procedural content generation is the name given to the set of techniques that focus on designing models that can be parametrically controlled. Procedural content generation and design are slowly becoming the norm in game development. The major advantage of procedural sound design is the substantial reduction in the effort required to record sounds. In addition it allows the game designer to avoid repetition by parametrically modifying the sound synthesis algorithms and the sounds that they generate in effect.The objective of this course is to equip the students with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to generate natural sounding, parametrically controllable artificial sound synthesis algorithms and sound effects.|Games are interactive applications and game worlds change with interaction. Audio content in games and virtual reality are typically canned recordings that are impossible to modify during runtime, preventing interactivity, causing repetition and increasing the memory footprint. Procedural audio generation by using interactive synthesis algorithms is a solution to circumvent these problems. This course aims to introduce the students to the concepts and underpinnings of procedural audio as well as give them the practical knowhow on procedural sound design for games.|Upon successful completion of this course the students will:learn the basic concepts of procedural sound design,learn the basics of human auditory system, auditory cognition, auditory memorylearn to use the Pure Data graphical programming languagelearn the basic artificial sound synthesis techniqueslearn to carry out modular analysis on sounding objects and combine different components in a meaningful and systematic waylearn about event-based parametric sound synthesis modelsgain practical experience in designing a variety of sound effects that can be used in gamesdesign, test, and deploy their first parametric sound synthesis model

If a player/user is positioned in a virtual room with other sounding objects, the realism of perception, localization of these sound sources, and the perception of the virtual environment requires auditory feedback from the modeled virtual environment. Similarly expressive synthetic audio is necessary to improve the realism of such applications. Sound objects in computer games are typically canned (i.e. pre- recorded) sounds, also known asfoley sounds. This approach is useful, but insufficient in that repetition of canned sound effects cause boredom and reduce realism. This course aims to provide students with the necessary background and skills together with an in-depth understanding of virtual and synthetic audio.The course will first aim to bring all students to the same level on fundamental concepts of digital audio, including, sampling, frequency-domain representations, filtering, and time-frequency analysis. Human auditory perception, including concepts such as critical bands, perception of pitch, timbre, loudness, rhythm, and texture; as well as masking will be covered. Spatial auditory perception will be covered specifically including its aspects relevant to game audio such as binaural hearing, localization of sound sources in 3D space, and distance perception. Concepts related to room acoustics modeling, simulation and auralization will be covered from game audio perspective. Artificial reverberators which are strongly related to perception-based simulation of room acoustics will be covered in detail. Most important existing and emerging spatial audio reproduction techniques will be covered. Subjective evaluation of spatial audio systems and algorithms including experiment design, ITU recommendations, and statistical analysis of results will be discussed. Coding of spatial audio for use in computer games and virtual reality applications will be given with existing MPEG standards. Discussion of sound synthesis will include a brief review ofexisting speech, musical instrument, and environmental sound synthesis methods. Special emphasis will be given to expressive synthesis and morphing techniques that allow using the same sound synthesis method to generate perceptually similar but not identical sounds. Finally, existing game audio APIs will be reviewed.|Spatial and synthetic audio are key elements of computer games and virtual reality applications where a high level of realism and immersiveness is desired within computational limitations of available hardware. The entire chain of processes from the production of sound to its perception all play part in the success of game audio systems. This course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of spatial and synthetic audio for computer games and virtual reality with a clear focus on development of algorithms for such applications. Students will learn about Fundamentals of digital audio, psychoacoustics, spatial hearing mechanism, room acoustics modelling and auralization, 3D audio reproduction, and sound synthesis methods.|By successful completion of this course the students will:• learn the basic concepts of digital audio,• learn the basics of human auditory perception and spatial hearing,• learn how acoustics of enclosed spaces can be modeled, simulated, and auralized and how these modelscan be incorporated to computer games and virtual reality applications,• gain knowledge on different 3D audio systems and usage scenarios,• learn about subjective evaluation of game audio algorithms,• have a working knowledge of different sound synthesis methods,• gain familiarity with different audio APIs,• develop audio algorithm development skills for games and virtual reality applications • improve their technical writing skills

Data from user experience during gameplay provides valuable insight into the level of satisfaction that computer games can offer. Information gathered from such data can also be used to design games that are more involving and thus commercially more profitable.Games are essentially based on interactive multimodal media which involve visual, auditory, and (sometimes) tactile aspects. While there exist many different quantitative strategies to evaluate individual modalities in isolation, interaction between different modalities as well as being in an interactive setting makes it harder to apply such strategies for evaluating user experience with games. Instead, more qualitative approaches are used for such assessments.The course aims to teach the current trends and approaches to game evaluation. The contents of the course will cover several different aspects of game metrics. A general introduction to the assessment of games will be covered first, together with Hawthorne effect which indicates behavioral modifications of “observed” subjects. Then, the statistical tools necessary to evaluate subjective results will be discussed. The implications of game metrics in the design and development of games will then be discussed. Networked, multiplayer games present another level of complexity as social interaction also takes place. Concepts of presence, involvement, and their use for evaluating games will be discussed. Some games are less approachable because of bad design. Methods that will allow games with better approachability will be discussed. Post-game experience can also be useful in determining what aspects of the game to revise and what aspects to keep. Game controllers are evolving to allow exertive games as well as augmented reality with gestural interfaces. These topics will be covered. As the median age of gamers become higher, games are being adopted by a greater segment of the society and games which used to be the domain of youngsters is now played by toddlers for education, handicapped people for therapy, and elderly people for exercise and coordination. The aspects of games with such segments of the society will also be covered. The course also has a hands-on project for the evaluation of games using the concepts learned in the course. The students will present the results of their own evaluations on off-the-shelf games during the final two weeks of the course.|Measurement of usability and user experience in games during and after game development is a process that enhances greatly the overall quality of games.It is known that even very small changes can make a big prositive(or negative) impact on user experience.It then becomes very important to develop efficient and solid stratecies to determine whether a game provides a good user experience or not.This course aims to teach the fundamentals of user experience evaluation for games.|Upon completion of the course, the students will:• learn the basic concepts related to game metrics,• how game metrics can be used during development to enhance user experience in games • obtain the necessary statistical skills to analyse results of subjective experiments• learn how to design and run subjective tests to assess computer games• improve their presentation and technical writing skills
