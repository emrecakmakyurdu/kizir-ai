Data from user experience during gameplay provides valuable insight into the level of satisfaction that computer games can offer. Information gathered from such data can also be used to design games that are more involving and thus commercially more profitable.Games are essentially based on interactive multimodal media which involve visual, auditory, and (sometimes) tactile aspects. While there exist many different quantitative strategies to evaluate individual modalities in isolation, interaction between different modalities as well as being in an interactive setting makes it harder to apply such strategies for evaluating user experience with games. Instead, more qualitative approaches are used for such assessments.The course aims to teach the current trends and approaches to game evaluation. The contents of the course will cover several different aspects of game metrics. A general introduction to the assessment of games will be covered first, together with Hawthorne effect which indicates behavioral modifications of “observed” subjects. Then, the statistical tools necessary to evaluate subjective results will be discussed. The implications of game metrics in the design and development of games will then be discussed. Networked, multiplayer games present another level of complexity as social interaction also takes place. Concepts of presence, involvement, and their use for evaluating games will be discussed. Some games are less approachable because of bad design. Methods that will allow games with better approachability will be discussed. Post-game experience can also be useful in determining what aspects of the game to revise and what aspects to keep. Game controllers are evolving to allow exertive games as well as augmented reality with gestural interfaces. These topics will be covered. As the median age of gamers become higher, games are being adopted by a greater segment of the society and games which used to be the domain of youngsters is now played by toddlers for education, handicapped people for therapy, and elderly people for exercise and coordination. The aspects of games with such segments of the society will also be covered. The course also has a hands-on project for the evaluation of games using the concepts learned in the course. The students will present the results of their own evaluations on off-the-shelf games during the final two weeks of the course.|Measurement of usability and user experience in games during and after game development is a process that enhances greatly the overall quality of games.It is known that even very small changes can make a big prositive(or negative) impact on user experience.It then becomes very important to develop efficient and solid stratecies to determine whether a game provides a good user experience or not.This course aims to teach the fundamentals of user experience evaluation for games.|Upon completion of the course, the students will:• learn the basic concepts related to game metrics,• how game metrics can be used during development to enhance user experience in games • obtain the necessary statistical skills to analyse results of subjective experiments• learn how to design and run subjective tests to assess computer games• improve their presentation and technical writing skills

If a player/user is positioned in a virtual room with other sounding objects, the realism of perception, localization of these sound sources, and the perception of the virtual environment requires auditory feedback from the modeled virtual environment. Similarly expressive synthetic audio is necessary to improve the realism of such applications. Sound objects in computer games are typically canned (i.e. pre- recorded) sounds, also known asfoley sounds. This approach is useful, but insufficient in that repetition of canned sound effects cause boredom and reduce realism. This course aims to provide students with the necessary background and skills together with an in-depth understanding of virtual and synthetic audio.The course will first aim to bring all students to the same level on fundamental concepts of digital audio, including, sampling, frequency-domain representations, filtering, and time-frequency analysis. Human auditory perception, including concepts such as critical bands, perception of pitch, timbre, loudness, rhythm, and texture; as well as masking will be covered. Spatial auditory perception will be covered specifically including its aspects relevant to game audio such as binaural hearing, localization of sound sources in 3D space, and distance perception. Concepts related to room acoustics modeling, simulation and auralization will be covered from game audio perspective. Artificial reverberators which are strongly related to perception-based simulation of room acoustics will be covered in detail. Most important existing and emerging spatial audio reproduction techniques will be covered. Subjective evaluation of spatial audio systems and algorithms including experiment design, ITU recommendations, and statistical analysis of results will be discussed. Coding of spatial audio for use in computer games and virtual reality applications will be given with existing MPEG standards. Discussion of sound synthesis will include a brief review ofexisting speech, musical instrument, and environmental sound synthesis methods. Special emphasis will be given to expressive synthesis and morphing techniques that allow using the same sound synthesis method to generate perceptually similar but not identical sounds. Finally, existing game audio APIs will be reviewed.|Spatial and synthetic audio are key elements of computer games and virtual reality applications where a high level of realism and immersiveness is desired within computational limitations of available hardware. The entire chain of processes from the production of sound to its perception all play part in the success of game audio systems. This course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of spatial and synthetic audio for computer games and virtual reality with a clear focus on development of algorithms for such applications. Students will learn about Fundamentals of digital audio, psychoacoustics, spatial hearing mechanism, room acoustics modelling and auralization, 3D audio reproduction, and sound synthesis methods.|By successful completion of this course the students will:• learn the basic concepts of digital audio,• learn the basics of human auditory perception and spatial hearing,• learn how acoustics of enclosed spaces can be modeled, simulated, and auralized and how these modelscan be incorporated to computer games and virtual reality applications,• gain knowledge on different 3D audio systems and usage scenarios,• learn about subjective evaluation of game audio algorithms,• have a working knowledge of different sound synthesis methods,• gain familiarity with different audio APIs,• develop audio algorithm development skills for games and virtual reality applications • improve their technical writing skills

Data from user experience during gameplay provides valuable insight into the level of satisfaction that computer games can offer. Information gathered from such data can also be used to design games that are more involving and thus commercially more profitable.Games are essentially based on interactive multimodal media which involve visual, auditory, and (sometimes) tactile aspects. While there exist many different quantitative strategies to evaluate individual modalities in isolation, interaction between different modalities as well as being in an interactive setting makes it harder to apply such strategies for evaluating user experience with games. Instead, more qualitative approaches are used for such assessments.The course aims to teach the current trends and approaches to game evaluation. The contents of the course will cover several different aspects of game metrics. A general introduction to the assessment of games will be covered first, together with Hawthorne effect which indicates behavioral modifications of “observed” subjects. Then, the statistical tools necessary to evaluate subjective results will be discussed. The implications of game metrics in the design and development of games will then be discussed. Networked, multiplayer games present another level of complexity as social interaction also takes place. Concepts of presence, involvement, and their use for evaluating games will be discussed. Some games are less approachable because of bad design. Methods that will allow games with better approachability will be discussed. Post-game experience can also be useful in determining what aspects of the game to revise and what aspects to keep. Game controllers are evolving to allow exertive games as well as augmented reality with gestural interfaces. These topics will be covered. As the median age of gamers become higher, games are being adopted by a greater segment of the society and games which used to be the domain of youngsters is now played by toddlers for education, handicapped people for therapy, and elderly people for exercise and coordination. The aspects of games with such segments of the society will also be covered. The course also has a hands-on project for the evaluation of games using the concepts learned in the course. The students will present the results of their own evaluations on off-the-shelf games during the final two weeks of the course.|Measurement of usability and user experience in games during and after game development is a process that enhances greatly the overall quality of games.It is known that even very small changes can make a big prositive(or negative) impact on user experience.It then becomes very important to develop efficient and solid stratecies to determine whether a game provides a good user experience or not.This course aims to teach the fundamentals of user experience evaluation for games.|Upon completion of the course, the students will:• learn the basic concepts related to game metrics,• how game metrics can be used during development to enhance user experience in games • obtain the necessary statistical skills to analyse results of subjective experiments• learn how to design and run subjective tests to assess computer games• improve their presentation and technical writing skills

As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about differenttypesof structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language.|Natural language and linguistic knowledge. Language and grammar. Morphology. Syntax and grammatical structure. Semantics: Word meaning and grammatical meaning. Regular expressions and regular grammars. Push-down automata. An introduction to Parsing and derivation.|By the end of the semester, a successful student is expected to be able to:- construct and understand basic morphological and syntactic analyses of natural languge structure.- appreciate the structure dependent nature of human languages and how this is studied from a computational perspective.- construct automata, write regular expressions, construct grammars for computational tasks.- understand the complexity classes of formal languages, and their relation to automata- appreciate the close links between language, cognition and computation.

Subsequently the major empirical research domains of Cognitive Science will be covered on a weekly basis (language, vision, attention, learning and memory, theory of mind, action, evolution, brain, emotional and social aspects of cognition.) General academic skills such as academic reading, writing and discussion will be fostered through homework assignments and active in-class participation of students. Specific academic skills will be conveyed through three alternating blocks of teaching and practical hands-on training (conducting and analyzing experiments, collecting and presenting own data).

The novelty of the dynamic paradigm in terms of various dichotomies, e.g., change/process > state, timing > order, parallel > serial, will be pointed out to the students. Basic notions such as what complex non-linear dynamic systems (NDS) are and what properties they have (attractors, chaos, self-organization, etc.) will be explained.Second, this novel paradigm will be explored in various domains of cognition - visual perception, coordinated action, learning & memory, time, cognitive and language development, communication - in terms of behavioral and brain processes. The concept of ""emergence"" - whether and how novelty can arise in a dynamic system - will be discussed in philosophical terms.Third, the fundamental property of objects in the real world as well as (cognitive) processes of being ""fractal"" (spatially as well as temporally) will be brought to the attention to students."|Introduction to  various dynamical approaches to Cognitive Science (e.g., non-linear dynamical systems theory ,synergetics, chaos theory)-Basic mathematics of non-linear dynamical systems- Dynamical concepts (e.g., chaos, fractals, attractors, bifurcation, self-organization, symmetry-breaking)-Dynamical approaches in relation to computational and connectionist approaches to Cognitive Science-Theory, methodology and empirical applications of dynamical systems to major areas in Cognitive Science (neuronal self-organizations, visual perception, coordinated action, learning and memory, cognitive development, language/language acquisition, attention/consciousness, and social psychology)-The philosophy of emergence- Hands-on practical training with HTML-based educational material on the mathematics and science of fractals and chaos.|First, students will be able to critically evaluate and compare the three main approaches to Cognition – computational theory of mind, connectionism, dynamic systems – with each other.

In addition fixed, uncontrollable assets do not allow the modification of content with interaction. Procedural content generation is the name given to the set of techniques that focus on designing models that can be parametrically controlled. Procedural content generation and design are slowly becoming the norm in game development. The major advantage of procedural sound design is the substantial reduction in the effort required to record sounds. In addition it allows the game designer to avoid repetition by parametrically modifying the sound synthesis algorithms and the sounds that they generate in effect.The objective of this course is to equip the students with the knowledge, skills and tools needed to generate natural sounding, parametrically controllable artificial sound synthesis algorithms and sound effects.|Games are interactive applications and game worlds change with interaction. Audio content in games and virtual reality are typically canned recordings that are impossible to modify during runtime, preventing interactivity, causing repetition and increasing the memory footprint. Procedural audio generation by using interactive synthesis algorithms is a solution to circumvent these problems.

Data from user experience during gameplay provides valuable insight into the level of satisfaction that computer games can offer. Information gathered from such data can also be used to design games that are more involving and thus commercially more profitable.Games are essentially based on interactive multimodal media which involve visual, auditory, and (sometimes) tactile aspects. While there exist many different quantitative strategies to evaluate individual modalities in isolation, interaction between different modalities as well as being in an interactive setting makes it harder to apply such strategies for evaluating user experience with games. Instead, more qualitative approaches are used for such assessments.The course aims to teach the current trends and approaches to game evaluation. The contents of the course will cover several different aspects of game metrics. A general introduction to the assessment of games will be covered first, together with Hawthorne effect which indicates behavioral modifications of “observed” subjects. Then, the statistical tools necessary to evaluate subjective results will be discussed. The implications of game metrics in the design and development of games will then be discussed. Networked, multiplayer games present another level of complexity as social interaction also takes place. Concepts of presence, involvement, and their use for evaluating games will be discussed. Some games are less approachable because of bad design. Methods that will allow games with better approachability will be discussed. Post-game experience can also be useful in determining what aspects of the game to revise and what aspects to keep. Game controllers are evolving to allow exertive games as well as augmented reality with gestural interfaces. These topics will be covered. As the median age of gamers become higher, games are being adopted by a greater segment of the society and games which used to be the domain of youngsters is now played by toddlers for education, handicapped people for therapy, and elderly people for exercise and coordination. The aspects of games with such segments of the society will also be covered. The course also has a hands-on project for the evaluation of games using the concepts learned in the course. The students will present the results of their own evaluations on off-the-shelf games during the final two weeks of the course.|Measurement of usability and user experience in games during and after game development is a process that enhances greatly the overall quality of games.It is known that even very small changes can make a big prositive(or negative) impact on user experience.It then becomes very important to develop efficient and solid stratecies to determine whether a game provides a good user experience or not.This course aims to teach the fundamentals of user experience evaluation for games.|Upon completion of the course, the students will:• learn the basic concepts related to game metrics,• how game metrics can be used during development to enhance user experience in games • obtain the necessary statistical skills to analyse results of subjective experiments• learn how to design and run subjective tests to assess computer games• improve their presentation and technical writing skills

If a player/user is positioned in a virtual room with other sounding objects, the realism of perception, localization of these sound sources, and the perception of the virtual environment requires auditory feedback from the modeled virtual environment. Similarly expressive synthetic audio is necessary to improve the realism of such applications. Sound objects in computer games are typically canned (i.e. pre- recorded) sounds, also known asfoley sounds. This approach is useful, but insufficient in that repetition of canned sound effects cause boredom and reduce realism. This course aims to provide students with the necessary background and skills together with an in-depth understanding of virtual and synthetic audio.The course will first aim to bring all students to the same level on fundamental concepts of digital audio, including, sampling, frequency-domain representations, filtering, and time-frequency analysis. Human auditory perception, including concepts such as critical bands, perception of pitch, timbre, loudness, rhythm, and texture; as well as masking will be covered. Spatial auditory perception will be covered specifically including its aspects relevant to game audio such as binaural hearing, localization of sound sources in 3D space, and distance perception. Concepts related to room acoustics modeling, simulation and auralization will be covered from game audio perspective. Artificial reverberators which are strongly related to perception-based simulation of room acoustics will be covered in detail. Most important existing and emerging spatial audio reproduction techniques will be covered. Subjective evaluation of spatial audio systems and algorithms including experiment design, ITU recommendations, and statistical analysis of results will be discussed. Coding of spatial audio for use in computer games and virtual reality applications will be given with existing MPEG standards. Discussion of sound synthesis will include a brief review ofexisting speech, musical instrument, and environmental sound synthesis methods. Special emphasis will be given to expressive synthesis and morphing techniques that allow using the same sound synthesis method to generate perceptually similar but not identical sounds. Finally, existing game audio APIs will be reviewed.|Spatial and synthetic audio are key elements of computer games and virtual reality applications where a high level of realism and immersiveness is desired within computational limitations of available hardware. The entire chain of processes from the production of sound to its perception all play part in the success of game audio systems. This course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of spatial and synthetic audio for computer games and virtual reality with a clear focus on development of algorithms for such applications. Students will learn about Fundamentals of digital audio, psychoacoustics, spatial hearing mechanism, room acoustics modelling and auralization, 3D audio reproduction, and sound synthesis methods.|By successful completion of this course the students will:• learn the basic concepts of digital audio,• learn the basics of human auditory perception and spatial hearing,• learn how acoustics of enclosed spaces can be modeled, simulated, and auralized and how these modelscan be incorporated to computer games and virtual reality applications,• gain knowledge on different 3D audio systems and usage scenarios,• learn about subjective evaluation of game audio algorithms,• have a working knowledge of different sound synthesis methods,• gain familiarity with different audio APIs,• develop audio algorithm development skills for games and virtual reality applications • improve their technical writing skills

Data from user experience during gameplay provides valuable insight into the level of satisfaction that computer games can offer. Information gathered from such data can also be used to design games that are more involving and thus commercially more profitable.Games are essentially based on interactive multimodal media which involve visual, auditory, and (sometimes) tactile aspects. While there exist many different quantitative strategies to evaluate individual modalities in isolation, interaction between different modalities as well as being in an interactive setting makes it harder to apply such strategies for evaluating user experience with games. Instead, more qualitative approaches are used for such assessments.The course aims to teach the current trends and approaches to game evaluation. The contents of the course will cover several different aspects of game metrics. A general introduction to the assessment of games will be covered first, together with Hawthorne effect which indicates behavioral modifications of “observed” subjects. Then, the statistical tools necessary to evaluate subjective results will be discussed. The implications of game metrics in the design and development of games will then be discussed. Networked, multiplayer games present another level of complexity as social interaction also takes place. Concepts of presence, involvement, and their use for evaluating games will be discussed. Some games are less approachable because of bad design. Methods that will allow games with better approachability will be discussed. Post-game experience can also be useful in determining what aspects of the game to revise and what aspects to keep. Game controllers are evolving to allow exertive games as well as augmented reality with gestural interfaces. These topics will be covered. As the median age of gamers become higher, games are being adopted by a greater segment of the society and games which used to be the domain of youngsters is now played by toddlers for education, handicapped people for therapy, and elderly people for exercise and coordination. The aspects of games with such segments of the society will also be covered. The course also has a hands-on project for the evaluation of games using the concepts learned in the course. The students will present the results of their own evaluations on off-the-shelf games during the final two weeks of the course.|Measurement of usability and user experience in games during and after game development is a process that enhances greatly the overall quality of games.It is known that even very small changes can make a big prositive(or negative) impact on user experience.It then becomes very important to develop efficient and solid stratecies to determine whether a game provides a good user experience or not.This course aims to teach the fundamentals of user experience evaluation for games.|Upon completion of the course, the students will:• learn the basic concepts related to game metrics,• how game metrics can be used during development to enhance user experience in games • obtain the necessary statistical skills to analyse results of subjective experiments• learn how to design and run subjective tests to assess computer games• improve their presentation and technical writing skills

As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about differenttypesof structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language.|Natural language and linguistic knowledge. Language and grammar. Morphology. Syntax and grammatical structure. Semantics: Word meaning and grammatical meaning. Regular expressions and regular grammars. Push-down automata. An introduction to Parsing and derivation.|By the end of the semester, a successful student is expected to be able to:- construct and understand basic morphological and syntactic analyses of natural languge structure.- appreciate the structure dependent nature of human languages and how this is studied from a computational perspective.- construct automata, write regular expressions, construct grammars for computational tasks.- understand the complexity classes of formal languages, and their relation to automata- appreciate the close links between language, cognition and computation.

The novelty of the dynamic paradigm in terms of various dichotomies, e.g., change/process > state, timing > order, parallel > serial, will be pointed out to the students. Basic notions such as what complex non-linear dynamic systems (NDS) are and what properties they have (attractors, chaos, self-organization, etc.) will be explained.Second, this novel paradigm will be explored in various domains of cognition - visual perception, coordinated action, learning & memory, time, cognitive and language development, communication - in terms of behavioral and brain processes. The concept of ""emergence"" - whether and how novelty can arise in a dynamic system - will be discussed in philosophical terms.Third, the fundamental property of objects in the real world as well as (cognitive) processes of being ""fractal"" (spatially as well as temporally) will be brought to the attention to students."|Introduction to  various dynamical approaches to Cognitive Science (e.g., non-linear dynamical systems theory ,synergetics, chaos theory)-Basic mathematics of non-linear dynamical systems- Dynamical concepts (e.g., chaos, fractals, attractors, bifurcation, self-organization, symmetry-breaking)-Dynamical approaches in relation to computational and connectionist approaches to Cognitive Science-Theory, methodology and empirical applications of dynamical systems to major areas in Cognitive Science (neuronal self-organizations, visual perception, coordinated action, learning and memory, cognitive development, language/language acquisition, attention/consciousness, and social psychology)-The philosophy of emergence- Hands-on practical training with HTML-based educational material on the mathematics and science of fractals and chaos.|First, students will be able to critically evaluate and compare the three main approaches to Cognition – computational theory of mind, connectionism, dynamic systems – with each other.

Understanding the factors that influence acceptance of information technology is of interest both to researchers in a variety of fields as well as procurers of technology for organizations. In that, researchers have studied a range of issues related to IT Acceptance. At the highest level, `acceptance` has been regarded as the theoretical analysis of innovation diffusion. This approach is appropriate to start with basic of IT acceptance. However, rather than general technological innovations, precise analysis of information technology acceptance has become a central concern of disciplines. This course aims to focus directly on the determinants and importance of user acceptance, rather than the broad issues of social diffusion. A number of theoretical approaches shall be investigated throughout the semester for a complete understanding of the issues involved with IT acceptance. In that regard, in addition to independently examining these approaches, other fundamental issues including information technology management frameworks, information technology governance, control of information technology will also be covered in class particularly concentrating on the relationships between these fundamental issues and information technology acceptance.|Not Available

Understanding the factors that influence acceptance of information technology is of interest both to researchers in a variety of fields as well as procurers of technology for organizations. In that, researchers have studied a range of issues related to IT Acceptance. At the highest level, `acceptance` has been regarded as the theoretical analysis of innovation diffusion. This approach is appropriate to start with basic of IT acceptance. However, rather than general technological innovations, precise analysis of information technology acceptance has become a central concern of disciplines. This course aims to focus directly on the determinants and importance of user acceptance, rather than the broad issues of social diffusion. A number of theoretical approaches shall be investigated throughout the semester for a complete understanding of the issues involved with IT acceptance. In that regard, in addition to independently examining these approaches, other fundamental issues including information technology management frameworks, information technology governance, control of information technology will also be covered in class particularly concentrating on the relationships between these fundamental issues and information technology acceptance.|Not Available
