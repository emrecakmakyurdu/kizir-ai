Information Systems program aims to encourage the use and development of information systems to improve the conditions of the society and to contribute to the scientific and technological developments. To accomplish these goals, it welcomes graduates from different disciplines to meet the interdisciplinary graduate needs of the academia and public and private sectors; simultaneously pursues research and technology development among different disciplines. With the pervasiveness of information systems, the program serves all sectors, from business to defense, and students have a choice of conducting research in a multitude of areas.We have the following specialization options. Note that the same courses can be taken under different specialization options.
Data science
Digital transformation
Software Technologies and Management
Management Information Systems
Information and Communication Technologies

The complete list of the courses offered by the Information Systems department can be found at course catalog. Students can also enroll in courses offered by the other departments at METU provided that their advisors approve. Students are welcome to select electives from different specialization tracks.A common academic basis for incoming students is achieved via deficiency courses. Students are expected to finish the deficiency courses within a maximum of one year. The deficiency courses of the program are:
IS 503 Database Concepts and Applications / CENG 302
IS 504 Comp. Networking for Information Systems /  CENG 435 / EE 444 /CENG530
IS 507 Introduction to Software Engineering / CENG 350
