As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about differenttypesof structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language.|By the end of the semester, a successful student is expected to be able to:- construct and understand basic morphological and syntactic analyses of natural languge structure.- appreciate the structure dependent nature of human languages and how this is studied from a computational perspective.- construct automata, write regular expressions, construct grammars for computational tasks.- understand the complexity classes of formal languages, and their relation to automata- appreciate the close links between language, cognition and computation.|Natural language and linguistic knowledge.

For this purpose, the statistics textbook by Andy Field (2013, 4th edition) “Discovering Statistics Using IBM SPSS Statistics” is being taught. It comprises all major statistical tests, parametric (General Linear Models) and non-parametric, see course syllabus.This objective is reached by regularly attending the weekly lectures of the course instructor, three home-works, two short quizzes, and one exam at the end of the course.Minor objectives of this course are to provide students with an idea how to design experiments, operationalize their research idea, formulate hypotheses, interpret and report the statistical results.|At the end of the course students will be able to(1) choose appropriate statistical tests for a given research design and data sample(2) use (the current version of) IBM-SPSS(3) all major General Linear Models as well as Non-Parametric Models in the scope of the textbook(4) report the descriptive and inferential outcomes of the statistical tests and illustrate them graphically|Research methods: The students will be introduced to basic concepts of empirical research and experimental design: independent/dependent variable(s), variance. Methods and methodology of psychological research: experiment, observation, ex-post-facto design, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies. Statistics: The students will be introduced to Descriptive Statistics: building statistical models, the reason between polulation-sample, distributions, various mean values, variance, SD, SE, confidential intervals, test statistics, as well as to Inferential Statistics: General Linear Model (GLM), various forms of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA, mixed design ANOVA).

The research paradigms that study cognition beyond the actions and mental activities of an individual agent, such as distributed and extended cognition approaches, will be starting points for understanding human collaboration and cooperation in the forms of teamwork for small groups (that can afford direct, real-time, face-to-face, or online communication), and collective intelligence for organizations and societal structures. Starting from the relevant literature and research in cognitive science, contributions to the field from other research disciplines, including organizational behavior and theory, will be surveyed. A parallel literature of organizational behavioral sciences and industrial psychology has been studying collective cognition phenomena from perspectives of team collaboration, group dynamics and shared cognition.
