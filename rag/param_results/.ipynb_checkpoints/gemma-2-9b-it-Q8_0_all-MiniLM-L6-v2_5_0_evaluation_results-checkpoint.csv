This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'CYBERSECURITY PRIMER I To furnish incoming cybersecuirty students with working knowledge of:Computer architecture and\xa0logicProgramming language conceptsNetwork technologyOperating system fundamentalsCryptography At the end of this course, successful students are expected to:Be able to write basic programs and systems software (specifically in Python)Have knowledge of the logical and physical components of computer systemsUnderstand the basic concepts in TCP/IP networkingKnow the main components and interfaces of Unix-like operating systemsUnderstand the primary concepts of cryptographic systems Sorry no data is found for the course objective.']","
The Cybersecurity program focuses on protecting computer systems and networks from threats. Students learn about various security concepts, such as cryptography, network security, and ethical hacking. They also gain practical experience in identifying vulnerabilities, mitigating risks, and responding to incidents.

On the other hand, the Software Management program emphasizes managing the entire software development lifecycle. Students study topics like project management, requirements engineering, software design, testing, and deployment. 


In essence:
* **Cybersecurity** is about defending systems and data from attacks.
* **Software Management** is about planning, creating, and maintaining software products effectively.

Based on the provided course descriptions, **INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE (Course Code: 9010509)** seems most relevant to your query.  

Here's why:

* **Covers both technical and business aspects:** The course description emphasizes understanding data science concepts, tools, techniques, and their applications in real-world problems. This suggests a balance between the technical (data engineering) and analytical (data analytics) sides.
* **Mentions key areas:** It includes topics like data mining, machine learning, big data, visualization, and predictive modeling – all essential components of both data engineering and data analytics. 

While other courses touch upon related areas,  `INTRODUCTION TO DATA SCIENCE` appears to offer the most comprehensive coverage of both disciplines.



","Yes, the 'Data Engineering' course addresses both topics.","{'model_path': 'models/gemma-2-9b-it-Q8_0.gguf', 'embedding_model_name': 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2', 'topk': 5, 'prompt_template': 0}"

What is the grading system used in METU's graduate programs?,"['(1) Students’ semester Grade Point Averages and their Cumulative Grade Point Averages are calculated at the end of each semester and their standing related to success is determined. (2) The total credit points obtained from a course are calculated by multiplying the credit value of the course and the coefficient corresponding to the letter grade earned from the course at the end of the semester. (3) The Semester Grade Point Average is calculated through the division of the total credit points obtained from all the courses the student has taken in the concerned semester by the total credit values of those courses. (4) The Cumulative Grade Point Average is calculated through the division of the total credit points obtained from all the courses the student has taken up to that time, the semester concerned inclusive, by the total credit values of those courses. (5) The Grade Point Averages obtained in these calculations are expressed by rounding them off to the second digit after the decimal point. In rounding the numbers off, the second digit after the decimal point does not change if the third digit is smaller than 5, but it increases by 0.01 if the third digit is 5 or greater.

(2) In order to be eligible to take the DCE, students should successfully complete the courses and the seminar course, and their Cumulative Grade Point Average should be at least 3.00. (3) A student may take the DCE twice the most. (4) The DCE is administered twice a year, in May and November. The names of applicants for the DCE are submitted by the chair of the GSD to the concerned GS one month prior to the exam. (5) Students in Ph.D. programs must take the DCE latest by the end of the fifth semester, and students in Ph.D. on Bachelor’s degree programs must take it latest by the end of the seventh semester. (6) Comprehensive examinations are arranged and administered by a Doctoral Comprehensive Board of five faculty members from the concerned GSD who are assigned for a three-year term by recommendation of the chair of the GSD and approval of the concerned GSAB. The Board sets up examination juries in order to prepare exams in varied fields, and administer and evaluate these exams. An examination jury comprises five members, at least two of whom are from outside the University and one of whom is the student’s thesis supervisor. The supervisor has a right to vote. The DCE meetings may be open to instructors, graduate students and experts in the field. However, the audience is asked to leave the room during the decision phase. (7) The DCE consists of written and oral examinations that will assess the students’ competence in the related field and their disposition towards research. The DCE is conducted in English in its entirety. (8) Students who succeed in the written examination take an oral examination. The exam format and weight, success criteria and the calculation of the exam grades are determined by the Doctoral Comprehensive Board. The jury decides, by absolute majority, whether a student is to be deemed “successful” or “unsuccessful” by evaluating the results of the written and oral components of the exam. The concerned GS is notified of this decision latest within three days in an official report approved by Doctoral Comprehensive Board.
