This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all']","

Looking at the provided documents, we see that statistics is a foundational skill for Data Science.  Here's why:

* **Data Science relies on statistical analysis:** Courses like ""Introduction to Data Science"" and ""Introduction to Data Informatics"" explicitly mention probability and statistics review as essential components.
* **Understanding data requires statistical knowledge:** Data Informatics programs emphasize the need for students to understand data, analyze it, and draw meaningful conclusions. Statistics provides the tools for this.
* **Machine learning and predictive modeling:** Both of these core areas within Data Science heavily rely on statistical concepts and algorithms.

The documents highlight that a strong foundation in statistics is necessary for success in both Data Science and Data Informatics programs.

What is the grading system used in METU's graduate programs?,"['(1) Students’ semester Grade Point Averages and their Cumulative Grade Point Averages are calculated at the end of each semester and their standing related to success is determined. (2) The total credit points obtained from a course are calculated by multiplying the credit value of the course and the coefficient corresponding to the letter grade earned from the course at the end of the semester. (3) The Semester Grade Point Average is calculated through the division of the total credit points obtained from all the courses the student has taken in the concerned semester by the total credit values of those courses. (4) The Cumulative Grade Point Average is calculated through the division of the total credit points obtained from all the courses the student has taken up to that time, the semester concerned inclusive, by the total credit values of those courses. (5) The Grade Point Averages obtained in these calculations are expressed by rounding them off to the second digit after the decimal point. In rounding the numbers off, the second digit after the decimal point does not change if the third digit is smaller than 5, but it increases by 0.01 if the third digit is 5 or greater.

* **DD:** 1.00 (60-64)
* **FD:** 0.50 (50-59)
* **FF:** 0.00 (0-49)

The numerical values associated with each letter grade are used to calculate the Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA).

Can students switch from a non-thesis to a thesis Master's program at METU?,"['(1) Master’s programs are conducted in two modes, namely, Master’s programs with a thesis and non- thesis Master’s programs. (2) The aim of Master’s programs with a thesis is to have students access knowledge through scientific research, evaluate and interpret this knowledge and convert this acquisition into an academic product in the form of a thesis. (3) The aim of non-thesis Master’s programs is to have students gain expert-level knowledge in the related field and the ability to use their existing knowledge in professional applications. The duration of Master’s programs with a thesis', '(1) The Master’s thesis comprises the phases of thesis work, and following this, its defense before of an examining committee. (2) Students are expected to successfully complete their thesis work within the maximum duration. At the end of that period, students who fail to attend the thesis defense session are dismissed from the programs they are registered in. (3) Students who receive the letter grade “U” twice consecutively, or three times intermittently in their thesis work or related courses within the maximum duration are deemed unsuccessful and are dismissed from their programs. (4) The student whose thesis work has been approved as successfully completed by the thesis supervisor must put her/his findings on paper in English in accordance with the principles indicated in the METU Thesis Manual. The provisions regarding thesis defense are as follows: a) The student who has completed her/his thesis submits a copy to the thesis supervisor. The supervisor checks the thesis for plagiarism and writes a report on it. The plagiarism report, a copy of the unbound thesis and the thesis jury appointment form are then sent to the concerned GS with the approval of the GSD Chair latest one month before the meeting date of the committee. b) The latest date on which students may defend their thesis is indicated in the academic calendar for each semester. c) The thesis jury is appointed by recommendation of the thesis advisor and the GSD chair and the approval of the concerned GSAB. The jury is composed of three or five members, one being the thesis supervisor of the student, and at least one being a faculty member from another university. If the jury is composed of three members, the co-supervisor cannot be a member of the jury. However, the co-supervisor can be a jury member if she/he is a faculty member and if the jury comprises five members. d) The jury members convene within one month as of the date they receive the thesis to have the student defend it. The thesis defense, which must be conducted in English, comprises the presentation of the thesis work and the consecutive question and answer session, and is open to an audience. e) The date and place of the thesis defense is announced on the official Web page of the concerned GSD.

The concerned GS is notified of the decision of the jury latest within three days through an official exam report. The student whose thesis is not approved is dismissed from her/his program.
