How does the Cybersecurity program differ from the Software Management program?,"['Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: Introduction Over the past decades, developments in information technology have changed the way we live, and at an unprecedented rate. This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'CYBERSECURITY PRIMER I To furnish incoming cybersecuirty students with working knowledge of:Computer architecture and\xa0logicProgramming language conceptsNetwork technologyOperating system fundamentalsCryptography At the end of this course, successful students are expected to:Be able to write basic programs and systems software (specifically in Python)Have knowledge of the logical and physical components of computer systemsUnderstand the basic concepts in TCP/IP networkingKnow the main components and interfaces of Unix-like operating systemsUnderstand the primary concepts of cryptographic systems Sorry no data is found for the course objective.', 'Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again.

What are the core courses in the Cybersecurity M.S. program?,"['Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: Introduction Over the past decades, developments in information technology have changed the way we live, and at an unprecedented rate. This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues.

This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues.

What are the elective options in the Cybersecurity program?,"['Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: Introduction Over the past decades, developments in information technology have changed the way we live, and at an unprecedented rate. This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'MACHINE LEARNING DESIGN AND APPLICATION FOR CYBER SECURITY The objective of this course is to give the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and introduce the students with setting up the coding environment, data manipulation and classification execution stages, different techniques of machine learning.At the end of the course, the students are expected to learn different data mining techniques, coding in an interactive Python environment using artificial intelligence related libraries, executing different machine learning methods with a cyber security view.

Can students switch from a non-thesis to a thesis Master's program at METU?,"['(1) Master’s programs are conducted in two modes, namely, Master’s programs with a thesis and non- thesis Master’s programs. (2) The aim of Master’s programs with a thesis is to have students access knowledge through scientific research, evaluate and interpret this knowledge and convert this acquisition into an academic product in the form of a thesis. (3) The aim of non-thesis Master’s programs is to have students gain expert-level knowledge in the related field and the ability to use their existing knowledge in professional applications. The duration of Master’s programs with a thesis', '(1) A non-thesis Master’s program consists of at least ten courses with a total of thirty credits, a Semester Project course and at least sixty ECTS-credits. The student must register for the semester project in the semester it is offered and submit a written report at the end of that semester. The semester project is a non-credit course, and is evaluated as ""Successful"" or ""Unsuccessful"". (2) In non-thesis Master’s programs, courses coded 3XX and 4XX may be taken provided that they were not taken during undergraduate education. However, only two of these courses may be counted in the course load of the program. Furthermore, students can select a maximum of two graduate courses offered in other institutions of higher education, by recommendation of the GSD and with the approval of the GSAB. In second-track graduate programs without a thesis, taking courses outside the program is regulated by the University. If the courses taken are counted in the course load ofstudents in accordance with the decision of the Graduate School Administrative Committee, the grade of the relevant course is not included in the GPA of students and assigned as EX (exempt). (3) A student who cannot successfully complete the course load (credit courses and the project course) specified by the GSD at the end of the three academic semesters, and/or whose Cumulative Grade Point Average is below 3.00 is dismissed from the program. (4) A student who successfully completes a non-thesis Master’s program with a Cumulative Grade Point Average of at least 3.00 in maximum three academic semesters is entitled to a Master’s degree without thesis.
