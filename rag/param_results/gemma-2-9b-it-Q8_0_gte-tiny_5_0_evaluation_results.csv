How does the Cybersecurity program differ from the Software Management program?,"['Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: Introduction Over the past decades, developments in information technology have changed the way we live, and at an unprecedented rate. This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'CYBERSECURITY PRIMER I To furnish incoming cybersecuirty students with working knowledge of:Computer architecture and\xa0logicProgramming language conceptsNetwork technologyOperating system fundamentalsCryptography At the end of this course, successful students are expected to:Be able to write basic programs and systems software (specifically in Python)Have knowledge of the logical and physical components of computer systemsUnderstand the basic concepts in TCP/IP networkingKnow the main components and interfaces of Unix-like operating systemsUnderstand the primary concepts of cryptographic systems Sorry no data is found for the course objective.', 'Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again.

What are the core courses in the Cybersecurity M.S. program?,"['Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: Introduction Over the past decades, developments in information technology have changed the way we live, and at an unprecedented rate. This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Graduate Program Details: to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again.

This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work.

This has led to countless new possibilities, as well has introducing new risks. The benefits have been so great that computers have permeated all areas of life, and reliance on complex, interconnected computer systems has constantly increased. Business, communication, finance, energy, health, governance, intelligence, defense, and even entertainment: we depend on computers for everything. Digital data stores hold state secrets, industrial secrets and intimate personal secrets alike. Thus, compromising the security of computers has become equivalent to compromising the security of states, businesses, and individuals. As a student of the M.S. Program in Cybersecurity, you will develop an understanding of what security is, and how it can be achieved. You will learn about ways in which the security of computer systems can be compromised, and what countermeasures can be taken to prevent this. They say with great power comes great responsibility. There is no question that computers have granted us powers that were previously unimaginable. As a student of cybersecurity, you will learn to wield this power, and to carry the responsibility that comes with it. You will become proficient at getting computers to do what you want, and you will learn how to prevent others from abusing those same abilities. In doing so, you will acquire the skills needed to ensure that future generations can look back to the dawn of the computer revolution, and remember it as a good thing. Program Aims Cybersecurity is a chain that is only as strong as its weakest link. This makes specializing in cybersecurity somewhat different than other fields. In order to evaluate or assure the security of a system you need to know how individual components work at a fundamental level, and you need to know how these come together to form the system. Developing a system to perform a specific function is hard. Ensuring that it only performs that specific function as expected and nothing else is much harder. The CSEC M.S. program is designed to empower its students with the skills needed to successfully deal with this complexity. Absolute security is not attainable. The student is taught how to approach the problem of coming up with meaningful security requirements and manage risks in a practical manner. Each student is expected to gain a comprehensive understanding of how diverse ideas and technologies come together to fulfill such requirements. The broad course offering allows students to go further and gain in-depth knowledge on constituent fields, such as cryptography and network security. Students are taught how security can be compromised in practice with hands-on training and lab work. They also learn what to do if a system they are responsible for is breached, taking mitigatory actions to alleviate the damage, and discovering what went wrong and what must be done to avoid it happening again. Moreover, they are taught about organizational security management and certification issues. As is the case with all', 'MACHINE LEARNING DESIGN AND APPLICATION FOR CYBER SECURITY The objective of this course is to give the fundamental concepts of artificial intelligence and introduce the students with setting up the coding environment, data manipulation and classification execution stages, different techniques of machine learning.At the end of the course, the students are expected to learn different data mining techniques, coding in an interactive Python environment using artificial intelligence related libraries, executing different machine learning methods with a cyber security view.

While none of these courses explicitly state ""data engineering"" in their titles,  **`KNOWLEDGE, DISCOVERY AND MINING (9010580)`** seems closest to covering both data engineering and data analytics aspects.  

Here's why:

* **Data Mining:** The course description heavily emphasizes data mining techniques, which are fundamental to data analysis.
* **Pre-processing Techniques:** It delves into data pre-processing, a crucial step in both data engineering and data analytics pipelines. 
* **Model Building and Evaluation:**  The course covers building and evaluating models, a core aspect of both fields.

The course also aims to guide students to take part in each step of language-processing research (e.g., generating a research question, designing an experimental study, testing, data analysis and reporting). Models for acquisition, processing and application of human knowledge as the object of cognitive sciences. Cognitive Linguistics as the investigation of the acquisition, processing, and application of language knowledge. Grammar as a model of human language knowledge. Relations of artificial intelligence.', 'THE GROUNDING OF LANGUAGE AND COGNITION IN PERCEPTION   This interdisciplinary course will study two main questions: How do language and thought relate to perception? How are symbols grounded in perception? To address the questions, we will present and analyze case studies in cognitive and language development, symbol grounding, and computational linguistics from the standpoint of cognitive psychology, philosophy, and computational linguistics.', 'ALGORITHMIC STRUCTURES IN COGNITION PLEASE VISIT THE COURSE WEBSITE AND COME TO THE FIRST HOURTHE INFORMATION HERE IS OUTDATEDThe course is an introduction to two foundational concepts in cognitive science: structural representations and computation. As empirical domain, we look at increasingly complex structural representations from morphology and syntax of natural languages. We couple this with an introduction to the theory of computation. We aim to establish that (i) human language capacity is (based on) a computationally describable unconscious system of rules and representations; (ii) that there are mathematically precise ways of talking about differenttypesof structural relations; and (iii) that bringing these two together opens up new avenues in the cognitive scientific investigation of language. By the end of the semester, a successful student is expected to be able to:- construct and understand basic morphological and syntactic analyses of natural languge structure.- appreciate the structure dependent nature of human languages and how this is studied from a computational perspective.- construct automata, write regular expressions, construct grammars for computational tasks.- understand the complexity classes of formal languages, and their relation to automata- appreciate the close links between language, cognition and computation. Natural language and linguistic knowledge. Language and grammar. Morphology. Syntax and grammatical structure. Semantics: Word meaning and grammatical meaning.
